# Kubernetes: Clean pods older than X days

Delete pods older than X days. The python script uses the `Kubernetes API` and the `TOKEN` from a service account to calculate and delete pods older than X days.

I use this Docker for clean up the pods created by Airflow (Kubernetes Operator), when Airflow deploys a pod the pod get the status `Completed` or `Error` and is not delete after complete the task, also I don't want to delete them at the end of the execution because we lost the logs, so execute this Docker as a cronjob every day (at 5am) and delete the pods older than 2 days after the creation time.

## Pod status

The pods can get the following status:

- Pending
- Running
- Succeeded (Completed)
- Failed (Error)
- Unknown

## Cronjob for Kubernetes

- Replace the namespace `default` for yours.
- Replace the service account `demo-user` for yours.
- The service account need to have permissions for list and delete pods for the namespace defined.
- The environment variable `POD_STATUS` supports a list separated by commas.

Manifest `clean-pods.yaml`

```

              - name: POD_STATUS
                value: "Running"
```

## Service account for Kubernetes

Service account for the namespace `default` with enoght permissions to list and delete pods.
